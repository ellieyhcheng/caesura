Heralds draped in\nThe softest silk robes, trumpet my arrival.\nThe Sun will see you now, says them.\nI peel back the ivory drapes\nAtop the gilt chaise,\nA leg strewn carelessly\nAn arm draped across his eyes\nThe other hung listlessly.\nThe Sun is dying.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Sun God","date":"February 03, 2021"},"excerpt":"I was invited to visit the city of the Sun"},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Starry Night Sky"},"fields":{"slug":"/starry-night-sky/"},"id":"3fe53d72-70c9-5f56-9855-8458a74d3831"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"The Sun God"},"fields":{"slug":"/the-sun-god/"},"id":"dad2366a-36b2-55d6-9222-0f376bd0b889"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"unforgotten"},"fields":{"slug":"/unforgotten/"},"id":"056b38ca-0089-540d-a1d1-1d8dd58e2592"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"agathokakological"},"fields":{"slug":"/agathokakological/"},"id":"a1adb92c-5e00-5ad5-9745-df23bd6cc662"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/the-sun-god/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
