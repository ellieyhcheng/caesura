Kingdoms rise, empires fall, dynasties overthrown.
But what of the rulers on thrones of bones?<!-- end -->

Now, where did it all begin?
You kneel before me and crown me king.
I say, but the crown of bones is a shackle
Chaining the king of the living 
To the kingdom of the past and gone.
You say, heart of stone, or heart of fire,
What does it really matter?

A cliff stands between what you see and what I see.
You tell me to make new decrees,
While all I'm writing are useless drivel. 
Trust me, we are both looking, 
But which one of us is seeing through tinted glass?
Which is worse? Those pledges without passion
Or these promises with no conviction?

A diamond in the rough, an imposter among kings,
A plastic doll in a garden of glass figurines.
Forgive me for the dramatic metaphysical metaphors.
But if my life is just an analogy,
Then let me be a figment of dust painted across the horizon.
Of what consequence is it then? 
In a matter of time, my era will come to an end.

Among the titans, I stake my claim
A crowning sceptor in my hands.
A dominion of ghosts to eclipse
But my soul is just a spectre.
What am I doing here?
Where the gods breath life to creatures with motions,
I am folding little paper cranes in the ocean. 

Grandiose tales of my feats
Outshine the pallid report of the deeds.
One day you will see, that atop my head
Is but a crown of dried marrow.
And the rings adorning my fingers
Are foam circlets painted gold.
But not today, for I want to reign for a moment more.

This castle holds my mirror court of invention,
But I live in a house of cards of my imagination.
How can I hope to prosper like the sun of yesterday,
Or ever shine as bright as the stars of this time?
I am a young god with too high a distance to fly,
And they say, a king among fools
Is the most foolish of them all.

The fear of fears staging a coup against me, a making of my own,
Forcing my grip tighter on my throne of bones.
