I was invited to visited the city of the Sun<!-- end -->
To see the austere Palace of gold and white,
Where lights never dimmed and life never ended.
As I cross the gilded gates,
Lively chimes ring across the city —
Some momentous event I was lucky enough to see.
Only in the city of the Sun
Do the sunbeams dance across the plaza.
Look how the sunlight shimmers across my skin;
I hold my hand up to the Sun,
And the tips of my fingers glow pink as a couple's rose,
Like I am magic itself, ready to take flight to the air.
Fallen stars adorn the window panes,
The swords, the silverware.
The sparkles twinkle teasingly
As if to say, death will not be the end of us yet;
As long the Sun shall live
So I shall have purpose and life.
It is a city bathed in splendor,
Where citizens showered in gold dust
and view daily the glorious sunrise —
The dawn scattering stars to make way
For the majestic breath of the Sun god, 
Blessing the folks in their golden home.
Do you not want to live in the city of the Sun,
Where wisps of silver sorrow
Were never to be found,
Chased away by aureate breeze.
As long as the sun shall live,
The halcyon days will never cease.
I ascend the white marble stairs,
The clouds part before me,
As I set my gaze upon the grand doors
Of the Palace of the Sun. Heralds draped in 
The softest silk robes, trumpet my arrival.
The Sun will see you know, says them.
I peel back the ivory drapes
Atop the gilt chaise,
A leg strewn carelessly
An arm draped across his eyes
The other hung listlessly.
The Sun is dying.
