The first time we met<!-- end -->,
Eyes like deers caught in headlights,
I asked you out to dinner at our favorite diner.
I don't know why,
But my heart pulsed longingly rather than skipped a beat,
Like hearts of long-lost lovers rather than love at first sight.
But we were so good, like hot cocoa and snowy days.
We wore matching sweaters,
And slow danced in the dark,
Just like in my dreams.
The fairy lights dropped stars in your hair, so beautifully.
Hey, are you the angel in my dreams?

Haven't I seen you before?
This feeling of deja vu is banging at my door.
If I could just put a memory to the feeling of you,
Maybe I won't be lost anymore.
Did we meet at a bus stop
Perhaps? Or caught each other's eyes at the grocery store?
I can't stop wondering
Why my eyes won't stop stinging
And my heart won't stop yearning
For something I can't seem to remember,
Something right in front of me.

It's not you who's not enough,
My darling, it's me, it's me.
I feel so incomplete to not know
What's missing from me.
We traded screams and yells, blow after blow,
Over this hallucination of mine.
But I just can't let it go.
My heart,
It aches so.
Hey, darling, will you just tell me what I'm looking for?

What good is a bookmark in a book
If all that remains are torn out pages?
What good is ink on paper
If rain falls upon it before or after?
It tears us apart and puts us back together â€”
This unforgotten, unremembered echo of mine
Of you.
