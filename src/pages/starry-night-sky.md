laughter bubbling through the air <!-- end -->
our feet spinning magic circles
dancing under the stars 
knowing that we will be alright 

tracing infinity signs on your back
the universe knew everything
but it didn’t know us
the enigma of our time

fairy lights peppering mini stars
in your hair flickering like starlight
your twinkling eyes meeting mine
my smile shine twice as bright

forgotten are the pain and sorrow
so long! we’re at the aphelion now
all that is left is to go home
with memories of our time

a haven of you and me
and that is all we really need
you will always be home to me
no matter where we leave

we are nebulous stardust
coloring the night sky
our starburst hearts beating
to the song of our time

raise a glass to the stars
they gave us nothing and everything
but that matters none
for we make ourselves the suns of the sky

That last summer evening
Shoulder to shoulder
Watching the lights
Streak through the 
Starry night sky
All was good
And all was well
